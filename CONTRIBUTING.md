Issues](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/geti/issues) and submit
a [Pull Request](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/geti/pulls) to address it.
Note: Before you start working on it, please make sure the change hasn’t already been implemented.

### Report Bugs

If you encounter a bug, please open an issue in [`Github Issues`](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/geti/issues).
Be sure to include all the information requested in the bug report template to help us understand and resolve the issue
quickly.

### Suggest Enhancements

Intel welcomes suggestions for new features and improvements. Follow these steps to make a suggestion:

- Check if there's already a similar suggestion in [`Github Issues`](https://github.com/open-edge-platform/geti/issues).
- If not, please open a new issue and provide the information requested in the feature request template.

### Submit Pull Requests

Before submitting a pull request, ensure you follow these guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
- Follow the [`Development Guidelines`](#development-guidelines) in this document.
- Test your changes thoroughly.
- Document your changes (in code, readme, etc.).
- Submit your pull request, detailing the changes and linking to any relevant issues.

  You can expect a merge once your changes are validated with automatic tests and approved by maintainers.

## Development Guidelines

### Project Overview

Geti™ project is a monorepo designed to support independent development and release of multiple related
subprojects while maintaining a cohesive platform. Our architecture allows for flexible and modular development across
different components.

### Repository Structure

#### Directory Layout

```
├── Makefile.shared-*             # Shared build targets for different languages (go, js, python)
├── interactive_ai/               # Group of components
│   ├── services/                 # Group-specific libraries
│   ├── workflows/                # Nested group of components
│   ├── libs/                     # Nested group of components
│   └── makefile                  # Group-level build orchestration
├── libs/                         # Cross-project shared libraries
└── makefile                      # Project-level build orchestration
```

#### Component Structure

Each component typically includes:

- `app/`: Source code
- `chart/`: Helm chart for Kubernetes deployment
- `Dockerfile`: Container build specifications
- `makefile`: Component-specific build targets
- `version`: Component version tracking file

#### Library Types

1. **Group-Specific Libraries**
    - Scoped to specific service groups
    - Minimize rebuild dependencies
    - Prevent unnecessary cross-component coupling

2. **Cross-Project Libraries**
    - Shared across entire monorepo
    - Kept minimal to reduce rebuild impact
    - Contains universal utilities and shared resources

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Local Kubernetes cluster (kind, k3s, or minikube)
- Docker
- Helm (v3+)
- kubectl
- make (optional)

#### Setup Steps

1. Clone the repository
2. Configure local Docker registry
    ```bash
    docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --restart=always --name registry registry:3
    ```
3. Build and push all images to local registry
    ```bash
    # from root of the repository
    make build-image
    
    # to push to local registry
    make publish-image
    ```
4. Build and push helm charts
    ```bash
    # from root of the repository
    make build-umbrella-chart
    
    # to push to local registry
    make publish-umbrella-chart
    ```
5. Install Geti™ on your local machine
    ```bash
    # copy installer to directory eq. /tmp/geti
    cp platform/services/installer/platform_<TAG>/platform_installer /tmp/geti
   
    # launch installation and follow prompts
    cd /tmp/geti
    ./platform_installer install
    ```

### Local Development

#### Building a project or component

```bash
# Navigate to the component directory
cd path/to/component

# Build the component
make build-image

# Run tests
make tests
```

#### Build Targets

- `clean`: Remove build artifacts
- `lint`: Run linter in "fix" mode to automatically correct code where possible
- `static-code-analysis`: Run static analysis/linters in read-only mode
- `test-unit`: Run unit tests
- `test-integration`: Run integration tests
- `test-component`: Run component-specific tests
- `test`: Run all types of tests
- `coverage`: Run tests and generate a coverage profile
- `build`: Create binaries
- `publish`: Publish artifacts to registries
- `build-image`: Build a container image
- `build-chart`: Build a helm chart
- `publish-image`: Publish a container image
- `lint-chart`: Lint a helm chart
- `clean-chart`: Clean built charts
- `publish-chart`: Publish a helm chart
- `list-image`: List component Docker images
- `list-umbrella-chart`: List umbrella charts

## Sign your work
