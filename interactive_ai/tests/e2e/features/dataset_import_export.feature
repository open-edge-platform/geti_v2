Feature: dataset import and export
  The user can export datasets in various formats and import them back into the platform.

  Background: Geti platform with a workspace
    Given a workspace

  Scenario Outline: project creation through dataset import
    Given a '<dataset_format>' dataset with '<annotation_type>'-like annotations
      When the user uploads the dataset to the platform to create a new project
      Then a job of type 'prepare_import_to_new_project' is scheduled
      And the job completes successfully within 3 minutes
      And '<project_type>' is recognized as one of the project types compatible with the dataset
      When the user chooses '<project_type>' as the type of the new project to create via import
      Then a job of type 'perform_import_to_new_project' is scheduled
      And the job completes successfully within 3 minutes
      And a project of type '<project_type>' is created from 'perform_import_to_new_project' job
