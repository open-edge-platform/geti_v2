Feature: Model training
  The user can train AI models for any project.

  Background: Geti platform with a workspace
  Given a workspace

  Scenario Outline: training with default model architecture
    Given an annotated project of type '<project_type>'
      When the user requests to train a model
      Then a job of type 'train' is scheduled
      And the job completes successfully within 15 minutes
      And a model of type '<model_template_id>' is created
      And the model has training-time statistics
      And the model has a training dataset
