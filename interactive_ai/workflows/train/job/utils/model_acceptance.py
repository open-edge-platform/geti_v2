    Check if a new model should be accepted or rejected based on its performance
    and other considerations relative to the previous models.

    In case of lower performance w.r.t. the previously trained model, the statistical
    significance of this drop is assessed through the "proportion Z-test": only
    significantly worse models (p <= 0.5) are rejected.
    The Z-test takes into account both the performance value and the size of the
    validation dataset on which the statistic is computed.

    Summarizing, a model is accepted if any of these conditions is satisfied:
     - perf_new > perf_old (better)
     - p-value of Z-test > 0.05 (not significantly worse)
     - no previous revision exists (first training or from scratch)
